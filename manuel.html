Hi, I am Manuel, a Software Guy that also loves Hardware!
</h3>

<p>
I am a team player passionate about building usable and secure high 
quality software that makes a positive difference in people's lives. 
My objective is to join an innovative and energetic company where I 
can contribute creativity, flexibility, and a solid technical foundation.
</p>

<p>
I  love coding and configuration work, but I am also passionate about 
interacting with customers, vendors, and technical sales teams. 
Always curious, I aim to ask the questions that result in 
revealing answers. What I appreciate the most, however, is 
to become an indispensable resource to both clients and coworkers.
